  """Batched entropy model for continuous random variables.

  This entropy model handles quantization of a bottleneck tensor and helps with
  training of the parameters of the probability distribution modeling the
  tensor (a shared "prior" between sender and receiver). It also pre-computes
  integer probability tables, which can then be used to compress and decompress
  bottleneck tensors reliably across different platforms.

  A typical workflow looks like this:

  - Train a model using an instance of this entropy model as a bottleneck,
    passing the bottleneck tensor through it. With training=True, the model
    computes a differentiable upper bound on the number of bits needed to
    compress the bottleneck tensor.
  - For evaluation, get a closer estimate of the number of compressed bits
    using training=False`.
  - Instantiate an entropy model with `compression=True` (and the same
    parameters as during training), and share the model between a sender and a
    receiver.
  - On the sender side, compute the bottleneck tensor and call `compress()` on
    it. The output is a compressed string representation of the tensor. Transmit
    the string to the receiver, and call `decompress()` there. The output is the
    quantized bottleneck tensor. Continue processing the tensor on the receiving
    side.

  This class assumes that all scalar elements of the encoded tensor are
  statistically independent, and that the parameters of their scalar
  distributions do not depend on data. The innermost dimensions of the
  bottleneck tensor must be broadcastable to the batch shape of `prior`. Any
  dimensions to the left of the batch shape are assumed to be i.i.d., i.e. the
  likelihoods are broadcast to the bottleneck tensor accordingly.

  A more detailed description (and motivation) of this way of performing
  quantization and range coding can be found in the following paper. Please cite
  the paper when using this code for derivative work.
